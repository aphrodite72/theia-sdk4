# Theia SDK

The Theia SDK is used to integrate the Theia runtime with your application. By applying the Theia SDK, you ensure that your binary is suitable for [packing](./packer.md) and that you can receive crash callbacks and notifications from the Theia runtime.

To integrate the Theia SDK within your application, select the appropriate language from the navigation in the sidebar and follow the instructions on that page.
