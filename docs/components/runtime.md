# Theia Runtime

The Theia runtime contains the code needed to protect your binary. Each runtime is uniquely built to link with the metadata generated by [packing](./packer.md) your application, and uniquely protects your application only.

The Theia runtime consists of two files, by default named `preloader.dll` and `runtime.dll`. Both of these files are required to be shipped with your protected application to ensure that it runs successfully. Additionally, `runtime.dll` must always contain a valid code signature. Runtimes built by the Bifrost platform will be signed with a development certificate accepted by the runtime, but we recommend that you sign it with your own code-signing certificate if available.

You are able to rename both the runtime and preloader DLL filenames to make it less obvious that your product is protected using Theia. To do so, set the appropriate values in the [module](../configs/module-config.md) and [runtime](../configs/runtime-config.md) configurations. Note that the Bifrost agent will always return files named `preloader.dll` and `runtime.dll`, so ensure that you rename the output files if you choose to use non-default names.
